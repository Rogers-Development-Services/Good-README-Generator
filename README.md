# Good-README-Generator

This CLI application will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a professional README.md. When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

## Instilation

Still unsure, for now download this package as a zip and run npm install Good-README-Generator.

## Usage 

Input your desired specifications for each prompt, and it will generate a readme. It would be helpful for you to visualize how you'd like to see the readme.md presented, and take a moment to answer the required questions in a text editor before inputing them into this program. Then copy and paste each response question by question, that way you wont have to retype.

## Testing

Testing Instructions: Unsure

## Future Updates

This application is a work in progress, future updates will include:
